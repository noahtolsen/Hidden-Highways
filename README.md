# Hidden Highways

Hi there! For years I've been frustrated on roadtrips that highway exit signs only advertise bad, low quality food options like McDonalds and Subway. There are fantastic local options all across the country, but when driving alone it's not possible to take my phone out and find the local gems. 

Thats the problem I'm trying to solve with Hidden Highways. For now this is just me tinkering in a [FastHTML](https://www.fastht.ml/) app (shoutout to Jeremy Howard and the Answers.AI team for the awesome work there). In the long term the plan is to make this a mobile app which is obviously the better medium for this kind of thing, but mobile development is not my strong suit so I'm starting here.
